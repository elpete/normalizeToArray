## Introduction

ColdBox Elixir provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic Gulp tasks for your ColdBox application. Elixir supports several common CSS and JavaScript pre-processors, and even testing tools.

If you've ever been confused about how to get started with Gulp and asset compilation, you will love ColdBox Elixir!
